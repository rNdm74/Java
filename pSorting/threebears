the
story
of
the
three
bears
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
bears
who
lived
together
in
a
house
of
their
own
in
a
wood
one
of
them
was
a
little
wee
bear
and
one
was
a
middle-sized
bear
and
the
other
was
a
great
big
bear
they
had
each
a
bowl
for
their
porridge
a
little
bowl
for
the
little
wee
bear
and
a
middle-sized
bowl
for
the
middle-sized
bear
and
a
great
bowl
for
the
great
big
bear
and
they
had
each
a
chair
to
sit
in
a
little
chair
for
the
little
wee
bear
and
a
middle-sized
chair
for
the
middle-sized
bear
and
a
great
chair
for
the
great
big
bear
and
they
had
each
a
bed
to
sleep
in
a
little
bed
for
the
little
wee
bear
and
a
middle-sized
bed
for
the
middle-sized
bear
and
a
great
bed
for
the
great
big
bear
one
day
after
they
had
made
the
porridge
for
their
breakfast
and
poured
it
into
their
porridge-bowls
they
walked
out
into
the
wood
while
the
porridge
was
cooling
that
they
might
not
burn
their
mouths
by
beginning
too
soon
for
they
were
polite
well-brought-up
bears
and
while
they
were
away
a
little
girl
called
goldilocks
who
lived
at
the
other
side
of
the
wood
and
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
by
her
mother
passed
by
the
house
and
looked
in
at
the
window
and
then
she
peeped
in
at
the
keyhole
for
she
was
not
at
all
a
well-brought-up
little
girl
then
seeing
nobody
in
the
house
she
lifted
the
latch
the
door
was
not
fastened
because
the
bears
were
good
bears
who
did
nobody
any
harm
and
never
suspected
that
anybody
would
harm
them
so
goldilocks
opened
the
door
and
went
in
and
well
pleased
was
she
when
she
saw
the
porridge
on
the
table
if
she
had
been
a
well-brought-up
little
girl
she
would
have
waited
till
the
bears
came
home
and
then
perhaps
they
would
have
asked
her
to
breakfast
for
they
were
good
bears
a
little
rough
or
so
as
the
manner
of
bears
is
but
for
all
that
very
good-natured
and
hospitable
but
she
was
an
impudent
rude
little
girl
and
so
she
set
about
helping
herself
first
she
tasted
the
porridge
of
the
great
big
bear
and
that
was
too
hot
for
her
next
she
tasted
the
porridge
of
the
middle-sized
bear
but
that
was
too
cold
for
her
and
then
she
went
to
the
porridge
of
the
little
wee
bear
and
tasted
it
and
that
was
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
but
just
right
and
she
liked
it
so
well
that
she
ate
it
all
up
every
bit
then
goldilocks
who
was
tired
for
she
had
been
catching
butterflies
instead
of
running
on
her
errand
sate
down
in
the
chair
of
the
great
big
bear
but
that
was
too
hard
for
her
and
then
she
sate
down
in
the
chair
of
the
middle-sized
bear
and
that
was
too
soft
for
her
but
when
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
of
the
little
wee
bear
that
was
neither
too
hard
nor
too
soft
but
just
right
so
she
seated
herself
in
it
and
there
she
sate
till
the
bottom
of
the
chair
came
out
and
down
she
came
plump
upon
the
ground
and
that
made
her
very
cross
for
she
was
a
bad-tempered
little
girl
now
being
determined
to
rest
goldilocks
went
upstairs
into
the
bedchamber
in
which
the
three
bears
slept
and
first
she
lay
down
upon
the
bed
of
the
great
big
bear
but
that
was
too
high
at
the
head
for
her
and
next
she
lay
down
upon
the
bed
of
the
middle-sized
bear
and
that
was
too
high
at
the
foot
for
her
and
then
she
lay
down
upon
the
bed
of
the
little
wee
bear
and
that
was
neither
too
high
at
the
head
nor
at
the
foot
but
just
right
so
she
covered
herself
up
comfortably
and
lay
there
till
she
fell
fast
asleep
by
this
time
the
three
bears
thought
their
porridge
would
be
cool
enough
for
them
to
eat
it
properly
so
they
came
home
to
breakfast
now
careless
goldilocks
had
left
the
spoon
of
the
great
big
bear
standing
in
his
porridge
somebody
has
been
at
my
porridge
said
the
great
big
bear
in
his
great
rough
gruff
voice
then
the
middle-sized
bear
looked
at
his
porridge
and
saw
the
spoon
was
standing
in
it
too
somebody
has
been
at
my
porridge
said
the
middle-sized
bear
in
his
middle-sized
voice
then
the
little
wee
bear
looked
at
his
and
there
was
the
spoon
in
the
porridge-bowl
but
the
porridge
was
all
gone
somebody
has
been
at
my
porridge
and
has
eaten
it
all
up
said
the
little
wee
bear
in
his
little
wee
voice
upon
this
the
three
bears
seeing
that
some
one
had
entered
their
house
and
eaten
up
the
little
wee
bear's
breakfast
began
to
look
about
them
now
the
careless
goldilocks
had
not
put
the
hard
cushion
straight
when
she
rose
from
the
chair
of
the
great
big
bear
somebody
has
been
sitting
in
my
chair
said
the
great
big
bear
in
his
great
rough
gruff
voice
and
the
careless
goldilocks
had
squatted
down
the
soft
cushion
of
the
middle-sized
bear
somebody
has
been
sitting
in
my
chair
said
the
middle-sized
bear
in
his
middle-sized
voice
somebody
has
been
sitting
in
my
chair
and
has
sate
the
bottom
through
said
the
little
wee
bear
in
his
little
wee
voice
then
the
three
bears
thought
they
had
better
make
further
search
in
case
it
was
a
burglar
so
they
went
upstairs
into
their
bedchamber
now
goldilocks
had
pulled
the
pillow
of
the
great
big
bear
out
of
its
place
somebody
has
been
lying
in
my
bed
said
the
great
big
bear
in
his
great
rough
gruff
voice
and
goldilocks
had
pulled
the
bolster
of
the
middle-sized
bear
out
of
its
place
somebody
has
been
lying
in
my
bed
said
the
middle-sized
bear
in
his
middle-sized
voice
but
when
the
little
wee
bear
came
to
look
at
his
bed
there
was
the
bolster
in
its
place
and
the
pillow
was
in
its
place
upon
the
bolster
and
upon
the
pillow
there
was
goldilocks's
yellow
head
which
was
not
in
its
place
for
she
had
no
business
there
somebody
has
been
lying
in
my
bed
and
here
she
is
still
said
the
little
wee
bear
in
his
little
wee
voice
somebody
has
been
lying
in
my
bed
and
here
she
is
now
goldilocks
had
heard
in
her
sleep
the
great
rough
gruff
voice
of
the
great
big
bear
but
she
was
so
fast
asleep
that
it
was
no
more
to
her
than
the
roaring
of
wind
or
the
rumbling
of
thunder
and
she
had
heard
the
middle-sized
voice
of
the
middle-sized
bear
but
it
was
only
as
if
she
had
heard
some
one
speaking
in
a
dream
but
when
she
heard
the
little
wee
voice
of
the
little
wee
bear
it
was
so
sharp
and
so
shrill
that
it
awakened
her
at
once
up
she
started
and
when
she
saw
the
three
bears
on
one
side
of
the
bed
she
tumbled
herself
out
at
the
other
and
ran
to
the
window
now
the
window
was
open
because
the
bears
like
good
tidy
bears
as
they
were
always
opened
their
bedchamber
window
when
they
got
up
in
the
morning
so
naughty
frightened
little
goldilocks
jumped
and
whether
she
broke
her
neck
in
the
fall
or
ran
into
the
wood
and
was
lost
there
or
found
her
way
out
of
the
wood
and
got
whipped
for
being
a
bad
girl
and
playing
truant
no
one
can
say
but
the
three
bears
never
saw
anything
more
of
her
